Instead of estimating the conditional mean (as we will get into later), it estimates conditional quantiles using methods such as kernel smoothing, splines, or local polynomial fitting. This makes it especially useful for capturing nonlinear effects and heteroskedasticity, and for understanding how covariates influence the entire distribution of the response rather than just its average.\nLipsitz et al., 2018 outlines a package called quantreg.nonpar, an addition to the package quantreg, which can implement nonparametric quantile regression in the following way:\n\nlibrary(quantreg.nonpar)\n\n#fitting the model\nfit &lt;- npqr(y ~ x, tau = 0.5, data = mydata)\nsummary(fit)\n\n#making predictions\nnewx &lt;- data.frame(x = seq(min(mydata$x), max(mydata$x), length.out = 100))\npred &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = newx)\n\n\n\nParametric Quantile Regression\nFor prediction or inference of a global conditioned quantile.\nParametric quantile regression is a method for estimating the conditional quantiles of a response variable as a linear or explicitly specified function of predictor variables. Unlike non-parametric methods, it assumes a particular functional form for the relationship between predictors and the quantile of interest. For example, linear quantile regression estimates coefficients that describe how each predictor shifts the median, upper, or lower quantiles of the response (Mazucheli et al., 2022).\nBaione and Biancalana (2021) show a fantastic example of using parametric quantile regression to calculate loaded insurance premiums, based on individual insurance risk.\nIn R, you can use the quantreg package to do parametric quantile regression.\nQuantreg allows both asymptotic inference (fast, good for large samples) and bootstrap inference (recommended for small samples or non-normal errors).\n\nlibrary(quantreg)\n\nfit_median &lt;- rq(y ~ x, tau = 0.5, data = data)\nfit_25 &lt;- rq(y ~ x, tau = 0.25, data = data)\nfit_75 &lt;- rq(y ~ x, tau = 0.75, data = data)\n\n# summary() outputs bootstrapped standard errors and confidence intervals.\nsummary(fit, se = \"boot\", R = 1000)  # R = number of bootstrap replications\n\nnewdata &lt;- data.frame(x = seq(1, 5, length.out = 10))\npred_median &lt;- predict(fit_median, newdata)\npred_25 &lt;- predict(fit_25, newdata)\npred_75 &lt;- predict(fit_75, newdata)"

These local models can be linear or higher-order polynomials. Predictions can be continuous if the pieces are connected smoothly across intervals, or non-continuous if each segment is modeled independently, resulting in stepwise jumps at the boundaries. The simplest form is a constant prediction, where each segment is assigned a fixed value (possibly mean or median) yielding a flat, non-continuous prediction across points (Rodríguez-Arelis et al., Lecture Notes, 2026).\n\nlevels(fat_content$steps)\nknots &lt;- c(7.8, 14.6, 21.4, 28.2)\nmodel_piecewise_cont_linear &lt;- lm(fat ~ week + I((week - knots[1]) * (week &gt;= knots[1])) +\n  I((week - knots[2]) * (week &gt;= knots[2])) +\n  I((week - knots[3]) * (week &gt;= knots[3]))+\n  I((week - knots[4]) * (week &gt;= knots[4])),\ndata = fat_content)"

It can be performed using parametric methods, which assume a specific distribution of survival times, or semi-parametric methods, like the Cox proportional hazards model.\n\nParametric\nDistributional-based survival regression for inference or prediction. The idea is that we assume survival times follow a specific distribution, like exponential, Weibull, or log-normal. To model, we fit a regression model where the parameters of the survival distribution depend on predictors. Can be used for inference, to test significance of predictors on survival time, and compute confidence intervals for survival probabilities. It can also be used for prediction, to predict survival time distributions or probabilities for new individuals. Parametric survival regression requires assuming the correct distribution; misspecification can bias results (Mokhtar, 2024).\n\nfit.weibull &lt;- flexsurvreg(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = kidney, dist = \"weibull\")\nfit.ggama &lt;- flexsurvreg(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = kidney, dist = \"gengamma\")\nfit.lnorm &lt;- flexsurvreg(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = kidney, dist = \"lognormal\")\n\n(RPubs - Full code for Parametric Survival Analysis)\n\n\nSemi-Parametric or Cox proportional hazards regression\nModels the chance of an event occurring at a given time as a function of predictors, without assuming a specific baseline survival distribution. Only assumes proportional hazards (risk) - the ratio of hazards between individuals is constant over time.\nFor inference, it tests significance of predictors on hazard rather than directly on survival time. It can compute confidence intervals for hazard ratios, but does not require specifying the full survival time distribution.\nFor prediction, it estimates the relative risk (hazard ratios) for new individuals.\nLimitations are that it assumes proportional hazards; if this assumption is violated, model estimates may be biased. It also cannot directly model absolute survival times without additional assumptions (Mohktar 2024b).\n\nfit.g &lt;- phreg(Surv(enter - 60, exit - 60, event) ~ sex + civ + region, \n             dist = \"gompertz\", data = oldmort)\nfit.c &lt;- coxreg(Surv(enter - 60, exit - 60, event) ~ sex + civ + region, data = oldmort)\n\nBroström, G.

In an age of more and more data, learning how to properly analyse and model it is increasingly important.
